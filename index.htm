    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>
        Due to the inner peace I obtain by fishing, fishing is my favorite hobby.
        Personally, I love being in nature regardless of the reason.
        However, since an early age, I've always gone fishing with friends and family.
        I am to the point where fishing is what I resort to when I need some time away from work and school.
